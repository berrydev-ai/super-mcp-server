# Automated Project Management with Claude AI

## 🔄 **System Overview**

This document describes how OnScript API uses Claude AI workflows to replace traditional project management with intelligent, automated systems that provide superior insights and continuous optimization.

### **System Architecture**
```
GitHub Events → Claude Workflows → Automated Actions → Project Updates
     ↑                                                          ↓
     └────────── Continuous Feedback Loop ──────────────────────┘
```

## **1. Event-Driven Automation**

### **Trigger Events**
- **New Issues** → Auto-triage, estimation, assignment
- **PR Creation** → Auto-review, dependency check
- **Milestone Changes** → Impact analysis, rebalancing  
- **Time-Based** → Daily standups, weekly planning, monthly health checks

### **Response Patterns**
```
Event Detected → Claude Analysis → Automated Actions → Team Notification
```

## **2. Core Management Workflows**

## **5. Feedback Loops**

### **Short-term (Daily)**
- Standup reports identify immediate blockers
- Auto-triage ensures no issues go unprocessed
- Progress tracking catches timeline slips early

### **Medium-term (Weekly)**  
- Velocity analysis adjusts sprint planning
- Team performance insights guide assignments
- Process improvements based on patterns

### **Long-term (Monthly)**
- Strategic health assessments guide roadmap
- Trend analysis predicts future challenges
- Resource planning prevents capacity issues

## **6. Key Benefits**

### **Replaces Traditional PM Tasks:**
- ❌ Manual issue triage and prioritization
- ❌ Sprint planning meetings  
- ❌ Progress status collection and reporting
- ❌ Risk assessment reviews
- ❌ Resource allocation decisions
- ❌ Timeline management and tracking

### **Provides Superior Insights:**
- 📈 Real-time project health monitoring
- 🎯 Data-driven prioritization decisions
- ⚡ Immediate blocker identification and resolution
- 📊 Predictive timeline analysis
- 🔍 Pattern recognition in team performance
- 🚀 Proactive risk mitigation

## **7. Self-Improving System**

The workflows continuously learn and adapt by:
- **Analyzing Historical Patterns**: Velocity trends, success rates, bottleneck identification
- **Learning from Outcomes**: What estimation methods work best, optimal sprint composition
- **Adapting to Team Dynamics**: Individual developer strengths, collaboration patterns
- **Refining Predictions**: Improving timeline accuracy, risk assessment precision
- **Process Optimization**: Identifying workflow inefficiencies and automation opportunities

## **8. Two-Stage Issue Resolution Process**

### **How It Works**

#### **Stage 1: Project Manager Triage (Automatic)**
Every new issue triggers intelligent analysis:

1. **Technical Assessment**
   - Analyze complexity, scope, and technical requirements
   - Search codebase for related functionality and dependencies  
   - Identify affected components and potential risks
   - Determine issue type and technical approach

2. **Resolution Path Decision**
   - **Auto-Resolve** (Simple, well-defined issues):
     - Clear requirements with no ambiguity
     - Low risk and limited scope  
     - Standard implementation patterns
     - No complex business logic required
   - **Manual Assignment** (Complex/strategic issues):
     - Requires architectural decisions
     - High risk or significant system impact
     - Complex business logic or UX considerations
   - **Needs Clarification** (Unclear requirements):
     - Missing technical specifications
     - Conflicting or incomplete information

3. **Quality Gates**
   - Only PM-approved issues get `auto-resolve` label
   - Complex issues flagged for human oversight
   - All issues receive proper effort/priority estimates

#### **Stage 2: Resolution Execution**
Based on Stage 1 analysis:

- **Auto-Resolve Path**: `@claude` mention triggers automated implementation
- **Manual Assignment**: Issue routed to appropriate developer with detailed recommendations
- **Clarification Path**: Original author tagged with specific questions

### **Benefits**
- **Prevents Over-Automation**: Complex issues get human attention
- **Accelerates Simple Tasks**: Well-defined issues resolved quickly  
- **Quality Control**: PM analysis ensures appropriate resolution path
- **Resource Optimization**: Developers focus on strategic work

### **Labels Used**
- `auto-resolve`: PM-approved for automated resolution
- `manual-assignment`: Requires developer assignment
- `needs-triage`: Needs clarification before proceeding
- `pm-reviewed`: Project manager analysis complete

## **9. Workflow Files**

| File | Purpose | Schedule |
|------|---------|----------|
| `claude-project-planning.yml` | Strategic planning and sprint composition | Weekly + On-demand |
| `claude-milestone-management.yml` | Milestone tracking and optimization | Real-time + Weekly health checks |
| `claude-issue-management.yml` | Two-stage issue triage and resolution | Real-time event responses |
| `claude-progress-tracking.yml` | Reporting and performance analytics | Daily + Weekly + Monthly |
| `claude.yml` | Stage 2 automated resolution (PM-approved only) | Event-driven |

## **10. Getting Started**

### **Activation**
The system is already active and monitoring your repository. Claude responds to:
- `@claude` mentions in issues and PRs
- New issue creation and milestone changes
- Scheduled triggers (daily/weekly/monthly reports)

### **Manual Triggers**
Use GitHub's "Actions" tab → "Run workflow" to manually trigger:
- Sprint planning sessions
- Milestone optimization
- Comprehensive project health checks
- Velocity analysis reports

### **Customization**
Modify workflow schedules and prompts in the `.github/workflows/claude-*.yml` files to match your team's specific needs and timezone preferences.

## **11. Success Metrics**

The automated PM system tracks and optimizes for:
- **Velocity Consistency**: Predictable story point completion rates
- **Timeline Accuracy**: Milestone delivery within predicted dates  
- **Issue Resolution Speed**: Faster triage-to-completion cycles
- **Team Balance**: Optimal workload distribution across developers
- **Quality Maintenance**: Consistent code review standards and test coverage
- **Risk Mitigation**: Early identification and resolution of project blockers

---

**Result**: A self-managing project that operates more effectively than traditional PM approaches, providing 24/7 monitoring, instant issue resolution, data-driven decision making, and continuous process improvement without human intervention.
